# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock is a fun twist on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  
It introduces two extra choices — **Lizard** and **Spock** — making the game more exciting and less predictable. 🎉  

This variation was popularized by the TV show *The Big Bang Theory*, and it helps reduce the chances of a tie compared to the original game.
